# stm32x0-device-tests
The project “Device Tests” is a test suite for commonly used STM32 peripherals. There are seven tests to choose from; users may configure the settings in the user application file `main.h` to select the test and pins required. Users may select a test for various electronic components such as a LCD text display (all tests), buttons, and potentiometer-based dials, as well as STM32 peripherals, such as GPIO, TIM, EXTI, I2C, ADC, and DMA. The project is intended as a demonstration tool; users may adopt portions of the firmware for other projects as desired.

This project is dedicated to Vivonomicon, who created the “STM32 Baremetal Examples” blog series that inspired me to continue practicing my embedded software development skills that I initially gained from college. Link to his blog series here:
